# Machine Learning Course at YNU

Welcome to the Machine Learning course at YNU! This repository contains the datasets and Jupyter notebooks for the course. Each notebook corresponds to a specific topic, and the datasets are located in their respective directories.

## Contents

1. **Simple Linear Regression**  
   - Notebook: [work1 - Simple Linear.ipynb](./work1-SimpleLinear.ipynb)  
   - Description: Implementation and analysis of simple linear regression using a single variable dataset.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   - Notebook: [work2 - Multiple Linear Regression.ipynb](./work2-MultipleLinearRegression.ipynb)  
   - Description: Exploration of multiple linear regression with datasets containing multiple features.

3. **Logistic Regression**  
   - Notebook: [work3-Logistic.ipynb](./work3-Logistic.ipynb)  
   - Description: Introduction to logistic regression for classification tasks.

4. **Clustering**  
   - Notebook: [work4-Cluster.ipynb](./work4-Cluster.ipynb)  
   - Description: Implementation of clustering algorithms to group data points based on similarity.

5. **CIFAR-10 Image Classification**  
   - Notebook: [work5-CIFAR10.ipynb](./work5-CIFAR10.ipynb)  
   - Description: Implementation of clustering algorithms to group data points based on similarity.
