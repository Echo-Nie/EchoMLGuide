# Machine Learning Course at YNU

Welcome to the Machine Learning course at YNU! This repository contains the datasets and Jupyter notebooks for the course. Each notebook corresponds to a specific topic, and the datasets are located in their respective directories.

## Table of Contents

1. **Simple Linear Regression**  
   - Notebook: [work1.ipynb](./work1.ipynb)  
   - Description: Implementation and analysis of simple linear regression using a single variable dataset.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   - Notebook: [work2.ipynb](./work2.ipynb)  
   - Description: Exploration of multiple linear regression with datasets containing multiple features.

3. **Logistic Regression**  
   - Notebook: [work3.ipynb](./work3.ipynb)  
   - Description: Introduction to logistic regression for classification tasks.

4. **Clustering**  
   - Notebook: [work4.ipynb](./work4.ipynb)  
   - Description: Implementation of clustering algorithms to group data points based on similarity.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
